# Comparing data structures * *incomplete* *
Currently I have written a simple library for working with linked lists and variable arrays (my own implementation).

The main program successfully tests using the functions I wrote for linked lists and "varrays". Some test cases are intentinally erroneous, and errors are thrown when expected.

For more detailed information about how this is being implemented, see the comments for each function in "dstruct.h".

In the end, all allocated memory is freed (tested with Valgrind).

The ultimate goal of this project will be to create a library for working with multiple data structures/techniques (linked lists, dynamic arrays, pools) and comparing their usage, storage handling, and execution times.

"dstructs.txt" shows the output.
