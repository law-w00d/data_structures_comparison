# Comparing data structures * *incomplete* *
Currently I have written functions for working with linked lists, and the main program generates a basic linked list with these functions (with values coming directly from an array).

The ultimate goal of this project will be to create a library for working with multiple data structures/techniques (linked lists, dynamic arrays, pools) and comparing their usage, storage handling, and execution times.

"dstructs.txt" shows the output.
